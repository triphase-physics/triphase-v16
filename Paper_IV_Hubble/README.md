# Paper IV: Hubble Tension Resolution via Three-Phase Vacuum Structure

Verification scripts for Paper IV. Analyzes the Hubble tension through the
TriPhase framework prediction H0 = 71.48 km/s/Mpc.

## Scripts

- `fig_hubble_tension.py` -- Interactive Plotly chart of H0 measurements over time with TriPhase prediction band
- `robustness_analysis.py` -- Systematic robustness checks across measurement methods
- `monte_carlo_slope_amplification.py` -- Monte Carlo analysis of slope amplification effects

# Paper II: Dark Energy Equation of State from Vacuum Mode Structure

Verification scripts for Paper II. Derives the dark energy equation of state
parameter w0 = -181/216 = -0.83796 from vacuum mode counting geometry.

## Scripts

- `verify_w0_from_mode_structure.py` -- Derives w0 = -181/216 from 3 phases x 2 quadratures
- `w0_balance_equation_verification.py` -- Verifies the energy balance equation
- `fig_w0_comparison.py` -- Interactive Plotly chart comparing w0 measurements (WMAP, Planck, DES, Pantheon+, DESI DR2) against the derived value
